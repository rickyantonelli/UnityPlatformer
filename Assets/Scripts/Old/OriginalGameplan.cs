    Game Idea: Co-Op 2D Platformer that is about solving puzzles "Left Behind" (Something along these lines, can't really use Left Behind cause of TLOU) - 
        Want puzzles to be very difficult and more reliant on mechanical execution than skill

    First thought is that this is a game where the 2 players need to get themselves 













    Thematically this is about 2 best friends who get left behind from their respective community (group? village?). Early on in their adventure to catch up, they find an object "the ball" that grants them strong powers
        The "ball" can be passed back and forth freely. Powers unlock more as you go, but will start off with the ball resetting your jump.
    The catch is that the power is only available when the object is being held, leading to very difficult puzzles in getting both players to their level checkpoint
        Will brainstorm future abilities, but the idea is that the game is VERY challenging. One that can make it so you need to find a close friend to play it with and stick it out
        The idea is that getting one player up isn't too bad, it's getting both up that becomes complicated
            Going to require a lot of good level design that will not allow a player to just go to the top and drop it down to their teammate
